OVERVIEW
--------

The 2nd edition of the MCMI workshop invites contributions at the
intersection of multimodal learning and pattern recognition. Multimodal
learning, integrating text, images, audio, and other signals, has
become central to advancing pattern recognition. This workshop brings
together researchers across computer vision, audio processing, and
natural language processing to focus on shared challenges in fusing
heterogeneous data sources and designing systems that exploit
complementary modalities.

We welcome contributions on novel methodologies for multimodal fusion
and interaction, with applications covering human-machine interaction,
complex data analysis, and domains such as healthcare, where
multimodal approaches are proving valuable for diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. The goal is to promote exchange across traditionally
separate research communities and explore together new directions in
cross-modal representation and reasoning.
